## About Me
My name is *Samedh Gupta*, though I usually go by Sam. I'm a software developer
currently living in Boston, Massachusets.  

I started programming when I was 12, and I have been learning new things
everyday since. I have been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to explore
a wide range of technologies to build high performant software for different
projects.

Lately, I have been really enjoying programming with the Rust programming
languages and many of my recent projects have been built using Rust. I am a huge
programming language nerd and so I love to dabble in different languages and try
new things out.

I find myself specializing in back-end web development and systems programming.
When I first learned about concurrent programming I was blown away. For me, 
this opened a new world of possibilities and made it possible to do many
things I had previosly struggled to accomplish. 

Feel free to reach out to me!

##  Education

### Northeastern University
#### B.S. in Computer Science and Business Administration
When pursuing higher education, I strongly gravitated towards Computer Science but I
also found myself strongly drawn to the world of Silicon Valley startups. I was
fascinated by how a couple of people in their garage could come up with an
interesting idea and make it a reality. This is also the reason I have found myself
working at small to medium size companies 

Doing a combined major allowed me to learn both sides of the coin. This has made
me appreciate the process of product and especially software development in a
new light. It has let me appreciate the value of external factors when bringing
a new project to fruition.
