title: "Traveller Lang"
description: "A domain specific language for defining and managing flight schedules. Allows for definition of all available flights along with times and other metadata. Then a seperate construt would allow users to find paths through the flight graph using a breath first search. The graph query can have several types of filters like price, duration, and number of stops to allow users to write complicated scripts to explore the graph."
